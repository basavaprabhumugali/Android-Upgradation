Replace kernel 4.9.65 to 4.9.186

 1.  You downloaded Intrinsync provided releases notes for Android O along with getSource_and_build.sh
  2.  Able to download the complete AOSP sources. This contained the Linux kernel v4.9.65 version sources (in kernel/msm-4.9 folder)
  3.  Build using this was successful (Mahima’s old email)
  4.  This built image was flashed on sdm845 board by all of us day-before
  5.  Now as part of upgrading kernel alone, we were supposed to download v4.9.186 kernel/msm-4.9 project alone. I believe this also was done as everyone were doing the kernel patch analysis using this sources.
 
 6.  We ought to replace just the kernel/msm-4.9 project with the latest one. This can be easily done using git branch checkout
     *   We know QC's 10.0 Release is on CAF Tag - LA.UM.8.3.r1-05800-sdm845.0  - Linux Kernel 4.9.186. (Our Analysis Xcel’s README)
     *   $ git tag | grep LA.UM.8.3.r1-05800
        *   LA.UM.8.3.r1-05800-sdm845.0
     *   $ git checkout -b my_tag_LA.UM.8.3.r1-05800-sdm845.0 LA.UM.8.3.r1-05800-sdm845.0
        *   Switched to a new branch 'my_tag_LA.UM.8.3.r1-05800-sdm845.0'
     *   $ head -n3 Makefile
        *   VERSION = 4
        *   PATCHLEVEL = 9
        *   SUBLEVEL = 186

  7.  Now the situation is AOSP code is Android Oreo, just that we upgraded to Linux Kernel 4.9.186
  8.  Build and Flash to boot Android Oreo with 4.9.186
